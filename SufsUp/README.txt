Bootcamp Week 10 Challenge

Background: "Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii.
To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.

The challenge is in two parts: 1) Analyze and Explore the Climate Data; 2) Design a Climate App.

Part I: I'll use Python and SQLAlchemy (within a Jupyter notebook) to do a basic climate analysis and Data
exploration of the climate database. This will incorporate the following:
1. Importing the modules needed for accessing the database
2. Manipulating dataframes and conducting some simple analyses
3. Plotting the data.

Part II: I'll use Visual Studio Code and SQLAlchemy to create an App. This will incorporate the following:
1. Importing the modules needed for accessing the database.
2. Connecting to the database and mirroring it.
3. Creating static and dynamic API routes.


Note: Some of my code in Part II is duplicative, and a function - or functions - see appropriate. I attempted
to write a couple of functions to extract and convert date information, but my code kept throwing an error. I'll
revisit this as time permits.
